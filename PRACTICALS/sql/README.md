### SQL Prac-4 

Python script for adding records to a MySQL table through a GUI
This can only add more records and view the current records.
(*I would add more funtionality, but this is a school practical :/ )

## How to run locally?

`git clone https://github.com/Vyvy-vi/XII-CS-pracs/`

- Make a `.env` file in the `sql` folder with the following contents
```
MYSQL_USER = "mysql client username"
